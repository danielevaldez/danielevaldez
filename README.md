### Hey there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a tech-savvy Latino software developer currently enrolled in the Tech Elevator Java bootcamp, graduating in mid-August. 
I'm eager to collaborate on projects with my bootcamp colleagues. Plus, I've got a track record of creating impressive programs like a command line vending machine and a mind-blowing Java-based BMI calculator. And let's not forget the server-client money transfer app I built that rivals Venmo. With a degree in Business Administration and construction experience under my belt, I'm your go-to tech wizard with a DIY twist. 

Let's create something extraordinary together!
